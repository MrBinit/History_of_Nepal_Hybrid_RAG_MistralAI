Far from appearing monolithic in their beliefs, they are shown to have exercised different attitudes toward their domestic servants based on their own experiences, which were rooted in differing ethics formed by class, ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. The homes and servant quarters described by the author manifest the different aspirations and anxieties of the women and men who inhabited them, reflecting the broader social conditions of a nation divided by race, by gender, and by class.\n",

The author discusses the effects of the reverse migration, when domestic workers returned to their villages and transformed their homes in response to their encounters with the houses and neighborhoods of Johannesburg.\n"
