The original manuscript, written in Parbatiya with an admixture of Sanskrit and Newari, is in the possession of Professor Cowell. There is another redaction, or at least a similar work, recognized by the Gorkhas and Hindu races of the country, copies of which are in the British Museum and the University Library of Cambridge.\n",

In written as nearly as possible in their original form, the vowels having the Italian sounds. The different sounds of the letters &, t, and gh, in Sanskrit, have not been systematically indicated by points or otherwise. The Mumbhi often uses kh for sh, J for y, and b for U. In the names of some well-known places, and in such familiar words as Dunbar, Jung, etc., the usual spelling has been retained, more especially in the Introduction. Some names may be found spelled differently in different places; but this is usually not owing to any mistake, but because the words have intentionally been given as written in the original manuscript.\n",

The Appendix contains, among other things, Newari songs, and a list of the manuscripts which I have procured for the University Library of Cambridge.

Its length from east to west is about twenty miles, and its breadth from north to south about fifteen. The length and breadth vary greatly, as there are numerous spurs running out from the hills and enclosing narrow valleys; but the above is a fair statement of the average length and breadth. The more prominent mountain peaks are named as follows: to the north, Munichur; to the east, Mahadeo Pokhri, Seopuri, Kukan, and Kowhilla; to the west, un; to the south, Chandraguri, Champa Devi, Phurphing, and Phulchowk. The last-mentioned is the highest of the surrounding peaks, measuring 9,720 feet above the level of the sea. The other peaks vary from 6,000 to 7,500 feet. The level of the valley itself is 4,500 feet above the sea.\n",

The principal streams are the Bagmati and Vishnumati. The former rises from the northern side of the Seopuri peak, and enters the valley through a narrow gorge, about the middle of the northern side. It flows south and southwest to its junction with the Vishnumati. The latter rises from the southern side of Seopuri and Kukani, towards the northwest corner of the valley, and flows south and southeast. Both streams receive numerous small tributaries, so that when they unite, just to the south of Kathmandu, they form a considerable river, passing through a rocky ridge. The united stream flows which crosses the valley, by means of a deep narrow cleft, which is spanned by an iron suspension bridge, the only one of its kind in the country.

The town is built on no regular plan; but the main street may be said to run nearly north and south, and is crossed at various angles by several others, while between these is a network of narrow dark lanes.

The houses are from two to four stories high, and are all built of brick and tiled, except in the suburbs, where the roofs are of thatch. The better class of houses are elaborately ornamented with plaster and paintings, and the houses in general possess large projecting wooden windows or balconies, which are richly carved. Some of the windows represent a peacock with outspread tail, groups of figures of gods, men, griffins, others contain horses, birds, lizards, etc. of flowers.

Prithwinarayana then paid his respects to Ranjit Malla, and respectfully asked him to continue to rule as he had hitherto done, although he (Prthwinarayana) had conquered the country. Ranjit Malla replied that Prithwinarayana had obtained the sovereignty by the favor of God, and that all that he now asked for was to be sent to Benares. Prthwinarayana entreated him to remain; but the recollection of the treachery of the Satbahalyis was fresh in his memory, and he would not consent. Prthwinarayana then gave him leave to go, and also provided for his expenses on the road. When Ranjit Malla reached the top of the Chandragiri pass, he took a last view of Nepal, and with tears in his eyes exclaimed, \"The Satbahalyas have killed my son, then cursed Bir-Narsinha, and have caused me this sorrow.\" He then wished that his offspring look like Chandals, and that their brothers be taken from them to live in beggary.

He replied that, by the favor of God, he had ruled the country for a long time, enjoyed royalty, and built many monuments; that now he had nothing to desire but that he might be conveyed to Ghat at Pashupati; where he would obtain salvation (i.e., die). Prithwinarayana was touched by this speech, and consented to his being taken to Pashupati. He moreover gave orders to supply Jaya Prakasa with anything which he might desire to give away in charity, and for this purpose a sawar was sent to give away. Jaya Prakasa said that he wanted nothing but an umbrella and a pair of shoes. The sawar returned and gave the message to the Gorkha Raja, who was at once plunged into grief, and remained silent for a long time. The courtiers expressed surprise at the hesitation shown by the Maharaj in granting such trifles, when he had promised him anything he wanted to give away in charity. Prithwinarayana said that they did not understand the meaning of the request, which was that Jaya Prakasa wanted to be born again as his son, and thus to enjoy the kingdom again, which he was very loath to grant. However, as he had already promised to give him anything he wanted, the Raja mounted his horse, went to the place where Jaya Prakasa was, and, presenting to him an umbrella and a pair of shoes, said, \"I give you what you want, to be enjoyed by you not, however, during.

After this, he lived the life of one removed from worldly cares, following instructions of the late Raja, who, on receiving a defiant reply to some of his angry remarks, thought it best to remove himself to Kisi (Benares), for fear of an outbreak on the part of the traitor ministers. In Benares, Bhimasena Thapa became his confidant through his talents. He advised him to make some arrangement with the British and to return to Nepal, where he would then be able to punish the faithless and ungrateful, as the unlucky days were past. The Swami Maharaj then returned to Nepal after taking traitors' friendly leave of the British. He killed some and dismissed others.

              "Professor Cowell: The manuscripts were mostly bought through the materials on which they are written, i.e., palm-leaf (talc-patta & vulgarly tal-patton whence the name of the palm), fox the younger; paper. The ink of the batch (Bhriyd; vulgarly bho) is used in Nepal only for charms and amulets, of which I bought home one specimen (Addl MS 1578). At least I never saw or heard of wool or this material. The puja on which the later manuscripts are written is sometimes dyed black, in which case the writing is either yellow or white; according to a mixture of gold or silver will employ. Many prizes, brilliantly colored and occasionally gilt. The wooden covers among those of later date Addl HN 86-118 are especially noteworthy, marks of worship or carved brass covers, sometimes lacquered and painted with figures. Some of the older ones are finely decorated, occasionally, as banal as they are covered with small hard cakes or lumps of rice; dust; and red and yellow pigments, used by the natives during puja. The sliced thick, which were also attached to them, have been noted. Some of these Nepalese books are, I believe, among the oldest, if not the very oldest, Sanskrit in Europe. The dates depend, for the present, upon the authority of the native Pandits but will, of course, be carefully investigated by Professor Cowell in the Catalogue.\n",
